Some useful utilies for Minecraft on Python. mcpi module needed to work correctly. Translation to English soon. while creating this, didn't know about the Git system.
All the programs are sorted by genre: humour, building, final project, etc. To enjoy this project, you should install mcpi module using pip. Everything (except the server) is written by me on Python 3. The 'Server_GB' folder contains the 'start.bat' and 'start.sh' files to start server's work on Windows and Linux. The Minecraft version can be changed by replacing the Spigot core file. There are 1.2.5, 1.5.2 and 1.7.10 versions' cores in folder. To change the game version, you should replace the 'craftbukkit-1.2.5-R5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' to 'spigot-1.5.2-R1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' or 'spigot-1.7.10-SNAPSHOT-b1657.jar' for the indicated versions in start file for your system. 
That's all! Have fun!
